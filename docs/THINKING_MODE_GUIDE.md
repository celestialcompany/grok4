# Grok 4 Thinking Mode Guide

## üß† Overview

Grok 4 features an advanced "thinking" capability that allows the model to show its reasoning process before providing answers. This transparency helps users understand how the AI arrives at its conclusions.

## üîß How It Works

### Thinking Blocks
When Grok 4 encounters complex questions, it can use thinking blocks to show its reasoning:

\`\`\`thinking
Let me analyze this step by step...

First, I need to consider the context of the question...
Then, I should evaluate different possible approaches...
Finally, I'll synthesize the best response...
\`\`\`

### Visual Representation
In the chat interface, thinking blocks appear as:
- **Collapsible sections** with a brain icon üß†
- **Blue-tinted background** to distinguish from regular content
- **Monospace font** to show the raw thinking process
- **Expandable/collapsible** to avoid cluttering the conversation

## üìù Implementation

### Frontend (React)
The thinking blocks are rendered using a custom component:

\`\`\`tsx
<ThinkingBlock defaultOpen={false}>
  {thinkingContent}
</ThinkingBlock>
\`\`\`

### Markdown Processing
Thinking blocks use special code fence syntax:

\`\`\`markdown
\`\`\`thinking
This is where Grok shows its reasoning process...
\`\`\`
\`\`\`

### API Integration
The thinking mode is enabled in the system prompt:

\`\`\`javascript
const systemPrompt = `When you need to think through complex problems, use thinking blocks:
\`\`\`thinking
Here I analyze the problem step by step...
\`\`\`

After thinking, provide a clear response.`
\`\`\`

## üéØ Use Cases

### Complex Problem Solving
- Mathematical calculations
- Logical reasoning
- Multi-step analysis
- Decision making processes

### Code Analysis
- Debugging approaches
- Algorithm optimization
- Architecture decisions

- Brainstorming processes

## üîß Configuration

### Enabling Thinking Mode
Thinking mode is automatically enabled for Grok 4 model. No special configuration needed.

### Customizing Display
You can customize the thinking block appearance:

\`\`\`css
.thinking-block {
  border: 1px solid rgb(59 130 246 / 0.3);
  background: linear-gradient(to right, rgb(30 58 138 / 0.1), rgb(88 28 135 / 0.1));
  border-radius: 0.5rem;
}
\`\`\`

### API Parameters
No special parameters needed - thinking blocks are generated automatically when appropriate.

## üîç Examples

### Mathematical Problem
**User:** "Solve this complex equation: 3x¬≤ + 5x - 2 = 0"

**Grok Response:**
\`\`\`thinking
This is a quadratic equation in the form ax¬≤ + bx + c = 0
where a = 3, b = 5, c = -2

I can use the quadratic formula: x = (-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)) / 2a

Let me calculate the discriminant first:
b¬≤ - 4ac = 5¬≤ - 4(3)(-2) = 25 + 24 = 49

Since the discriminant is positive, we have two real solutions:
x = (-5 ¬± ‚àö49) / 6 = (-5 ¬± 7) / 6

So x‚ÇÅ = (-5 + 7) / 6 = 2/6 = 1/3
And x‚ÇÇ = (-5 - 7) / 6 = -12/6 = -2
\`\`\`

The solutions to the equation 3x¬≤ + 5x - 2 = 0 are:
- x = 1/3
- x = -2

### Code Review
**User:** "Review this Python function for efficiency"

**Grok Response:**
\`\`\`thinking
Looking at this function, I need to analyze:
1. Time complexity
2. Space complexity  
3. Potential optimizations
4. Edge cases

The current implementation uses a nested loop which gives O(n¬≤) time complexity.
I can see opportunities for optimization using hash maps or sets.
Also need to check for edge cases like empty inputs.
\`\`\`

Here's my analysis of your function...

## üöÄ Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Don't force thinking blocks** - let Grok decide when to use them
2. **Style consistently** - use the provided ThinkingBlock component
3. **Test accessibility** - ensure keyboard and screen reader support
4. **Optimize performance** - lazy load content for long thinking blocks

### For Users
1. **Use for complex questions** - thinking blocks are most valuable for multi-step problems
2. **Review the reasoning** - check the thinking process for accuracy
3. **Learn from the process** - use thinking blocks as educational tools
4. **Provide feedback** - help improve the thinking quality

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Thinking blocks not appearing:**
- Ensure you're using Grok 4 model
- Check that the question is complex enough
- Verify system prompt includes thinking instructions

**Styling issues:**
- Check CSS imports for ThinkingBlock component
- Verify Tailwind classes are available
- Test in different browsers

**Performance problems:**
- Implement lazy loading for long blocks
- Use React.memo for optimization
- Consider virtualization for many blocks

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- **Thinking templates** for different problem types
- **Interactive thinking** with user input during reasoning
- **Thinking history** to track reasoning patterns
- **Collaborative thinking** with multiple AI perspectives

### API Improvements
- **Thinking confidence scores** to show certainty levels
- **Structured thinking** with labeled reasoning steps
- **Thinking branching** to show alternative approaches
- **Thinking summaries** for long reasoning chains
